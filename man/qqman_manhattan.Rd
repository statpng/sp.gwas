\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame with columns "BP," "CHR," "P," and optionally, "SNP."}

\item{chr}{A string denoting the column name for the chromosome. Defaults to 
PLINK's "CHR." Said column must be numeric. If you have X, Y, or MT 
chromosomes, be sure to renumber these 23, 24, 25, etc.}

\item{bp}{A string denoting the column name for the chromosomal position. 
Defaults to PLINK's "BP." Said column must be numeric.}

\item{p}{A string denoting the column name for the p-value. Defaults to 
PLINK's "P." Said column must be numeric.}

\item{snp}{A string denoting the column name for the SNP name (rs number). 
Defaults to PLINK's "SNP." Said column should be a character.}

\item{col}{A character vector indicating which colors to alternate.}

\item{col.highlight}{A character vector of colors corresponding to the list of "highlight".}

\item{chrlabs}{A character vector equal to the number of chromosomes
specifying the chromosome labels (e.g., \code{c(1:22, "X", "Y", "MT")}).}

\item{suggestiveline}{Where to draw a "suggestive" line. Default 
-log10(1e-5). Set to FALSE to disable.}

\item{genomewideline}{Where to draw a "genome-wide sigificant" line. Default 
-log10(5e-8). Set to FALSE to disable.}

\item{highlight}{A list of character vector of SNPs in your dataset to highlight. 
These SNPs should all be in your dataset.}

\item{logp}{If TRUE, the -log10 of the p-value is plotted. It isn't very 
useful to plot raw p-values, but plotting the raw value could be useful for
other genome-wide plots, for example, peak heights, bayes factors, test 
statistics, other "scores," etc.}

\item{annotatePval}{If set, SNPs below this p-value will be annotated on the plot.}

\item{annotateTop}{If TRUE, only annotates the top hit on each chromosome that is below the annotatePval threshold.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to other plot/points functions}
}
\value{
A manhattan plot.
}
\description{
Creates a manhattan plot from PLINK assoc output (or any data frame with 
chromosome, position, and p-value).
