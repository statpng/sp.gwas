Title: Variable Selection Package Using Selection Probability for Genome-Wide Association Studies
Version: 1.3.0
Author: Kipoong Kim
Maintainer: Kipoong Kim <kkp7700@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides selection probability that can be used to prioritize variables for a given regularization model. For an analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, the regularization model can accommodate correlations between predictors rather than individual tests such as t-test and ANOVA. Moreover, the selection probability can prioritize the variables not depending on tuning parameter. This package provides output files of three types: (1) Matched data files (genotype, numerical, snp info, phenotype, QC results), (2) Selection result files (selection probabilities and empirical thresholds), (3) Manhattan plot.
