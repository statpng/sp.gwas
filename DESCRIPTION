Description: For an analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, the regularization model can accommodate correlations between predictors as well as outperform the individual methods such as t-test and ANOVA. Moreover, the selection probability can prioritize genetic variants for a given regularization model not depending on tuning parameter. This package follows 4 steps: (1)data import, (2)preprocessing, (3)genomic selection, (4)visualization. Specifically, it provides output files of three types: Matched data files (genotype, numerical, snp info, phenotype, QC results), Selection result files (selection probabilities and empirical thresholds) and Manhattan plot.
